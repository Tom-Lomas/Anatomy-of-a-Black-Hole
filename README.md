# Anatomy-of-a-Black-Hole

This is a basic website that I created about the Anatomy of a black hole. This website is mainly created using HTML and CSS. This website was made a couple weeks into learning website development so the warp files are a little weird and could most likely be done better which is something I would like to work on.

This specific website could be used to teach people about the anatomy of a black hole with interesting graphics and additional websites that are linked in the pages. I would like to note that these photos were not created or taken by me and I am not the owner.

If you would like to reach me for any reason you can email me at tom.lomas90@gmail.com.
